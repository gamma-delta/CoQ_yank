        Yes, yes! Wire! Beautiful wire! Oh, before I forget or cease to care, I threw together a yank for you. Use it if you need to return to Joppa quickly. Now give me a few minutes alone to attach the wire.

        Oh, I sell whatever sundries that meet my standards of quality, with some measure of curation. I try to ensure that my shelves carry a bit of many things, but you can count on finding more than enough ammunition and a few yanks that can pull you back here in difficult times.

        If you have anything in need of identification or repair, I can take care of that for you for a few drams as well.

        Lived most of m'life on a desert steppe twixt the flower fields of Qud and the M'ryee's salt pans.

        I ended up here when m'snapbrain cousin played tinker with one of them yankee doodads. The less said about all that, the better.
