# Yank

A Caves of Qud mod.

Replaces recoilers with "yanks," which break after being used once. Also adds the geofold yank, which brings you to the surface to help protect against getting permanently lost underground.

I couldn't figure out how to do this to the special recoilers (programmable, reprogrammable, and random-point), so I have instead gutted them and replaced them with something you can disassemble or sell.
